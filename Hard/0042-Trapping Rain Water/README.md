# 42. Trapping Rain Water

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Example 1

**Input:**

```text
height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
```

**Output:**

```text
6
```

**Explanation:**

The above elevation map is represented by the array `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`. In this case, `6` units of rain water are being trapped.

## Example 2

**Input:**

```text
height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
```

**Output:**

```text
9
```

## Constraints

- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^5`
